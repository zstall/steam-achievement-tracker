## 📝 Decision Log

### 2024-01-XX - Database Choice
**Decision**: PostgreSQL over MySQL  
**Reasoning**: Better JSON support, more robust for complex queries  
**Impact**: Faster development, better scalability  

### 2024-01-XX - Hosting Platform
**Decision**: TBD (Railway vs Render vs AWS)  
**Reasoning**: Cost vs control tradeoff  
**Impact**: Affects deployment complexity
